                    <li> Main Page </li>
</h4>
<section>
<p> Firstly, the main-page Interface was created, without the functionality. Therefore, the next step was to implement it.
</p>
</section>
<h4>
<li> API / DB </li>
</h4>
<section>
<p> The second step was to create a database and an API in order to guarantee a communication between the site and the database.</p>
</section>
<h4>
<li> Login / Sign up</li>
</h4>
<section>
<p> Then, we decided to implement login and sign up features. There was chosen an extra login possibility: login with Git. After being assured that both login and signup features work, we created the respective web pages.</p>
</section>
<h4>
<li> Leaderboard </li>
</h4>
<section>
<p> After creating and uniting the main and login/sign up pages, the next step was to create a leaderboard that takes information about users and their time from the db.
The web page was done after completing the scripting part.</p>
</section>
<h4>
<li> Challenge </li>
</h4>
<section>
<p> The last step was to make a challenge that keeps track of what user's progress is, the time that he needed to succeed in the certain task and saves the data that would be used in the leaderboard.</p>
