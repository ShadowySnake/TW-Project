 <h3> <li>Introduction</li> </h3>
  <ol>
   <h4> <li> Purpose </li> </h4>
	<section> <p> This project is realised in order to make a website that would help all users to learn or get better at both HTML and CSS. The users need to solve specific goals in each exercise they take, the difficulty being constrained by the skill level chosen by the user himself. </p> </section>
   <h4> <li> Document Conventions </li> </h4>
	<section> <p> There are not any conventions set by the team members nor any that would interfere with some standards.   </p> </section>
   <h4> <li> Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions </li> </h4>
	<section> <p> The intended audience is being represented by people that would like to try themselves under certain constraints. Being more precise, people of all skill levels that are interested in learning HTML & CSS or even returning coders will find this web page quite useful. </p> </section>  
   <h4> <li> Product Scope </li> </h4>
	<section> <p> This site offers a set of exercises designed for several categories of skills: beginner, amateur and experienced. A beginner can complete each level step by step and even beat the next ones if he is determined enough. Meanwhile a returning user could try and beat the revamped/newly added exercises on a record time. But the goal remains the same, to learn HTML & CSS in a fun and competitive way. </p> </section>
   </ol>
 <h3> <li> Overall Description </li> </h3>
  <ol>
   <h4> <li> Product Perspective </li> </h4>
	<section> <p> It is an independent project that sets certain goals, its components being operational standalone, constrainted by the operating enviroment. </p> </section>
   <h4> <li> Product Functions  </li> </h4>
	<section> <p> The site has a sign up / login feature that keeps track of each user's progress, thus saving it in a leaderboard specific for each level and exercise. Certain problems like re-doing the exercise by the user again in a record time could possibly be encountered, thus it might not be counted at all.</p>
		<p> There are several sets of exercises designed for users to learn HTML & CSS separately, but there would be some entwined exercises that would require certain levels to be done in both HTML & CSS. </p>
		<p> All the pages included in this project will be: Main Page, Sign Up Page, Leaderboard, Pages for all types of Levels</p>
